This project was intended to demonstrate a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm solving a maze puzzle.

This project is presented as a game that randomly creates a maze with multiple possible solutions.

The goal is to solve the possible using a shortest path.  

The "Show Algorithm" button demonstrates visually the BFS algorithm.
