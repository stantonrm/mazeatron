#####Final Project For CS 5130 - Professor Badri Adhikari - Fall Semester 2017

This project was intended to demonstrate a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm solving a maze puzzle.

This project is implemented as a game that creates a random maze with multiple possible solutions.

The goal is to solve the maze using using the shortest path possible.  

The "Show Algorithm" button demonstrates visually the BFS algorithm.
